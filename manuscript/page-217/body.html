That there’s a picture of a missel thrush on her nest, as large as life an’ twice as natural.”</p><p>Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He had meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden was her nest and she was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like that queer, common boy!</p><p>She hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep looking forward to the morning.</p></div> </div>

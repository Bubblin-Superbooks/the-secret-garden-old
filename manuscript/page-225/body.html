I won’t let people see me and talk me over.”</p><p>“Why?” Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.</p><p>“Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down. My father won’t let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed to speak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan’t live. My father hates to think I may be like him.”</p><p>“Oh, what a queer house this is!” Mary said. “What a queer house! Everything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens are locked up—and you! Have you been locked up?”</p><p>“No. I stay in this room because I don’t want to be moved out of it. It tires me too much.”</p><p>“Does your father come and see you?” Mary ventured.</p><p>“Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn’t want to see me.”</p></div> </div>

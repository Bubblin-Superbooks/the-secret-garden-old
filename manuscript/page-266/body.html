He must not talk too much; he must not forget that he was ill; he must not forget that he was very easily tired. Mary thought that there seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to forget.</p><p>Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed on Dr. Craven’s face.</p><p>“I <em>want</em> to forget it,” he said at last. “She makes me forget it. That is why I want her.”</p><p>Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room. He gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on the large stool.

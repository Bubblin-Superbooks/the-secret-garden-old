<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful. She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded her thin little black-gloved hands in her lap. Her black dress made her look yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under her black crêpe hat.</p><p>“A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,” Mrs. Medlock thought. (Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.) She had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and at last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk, hard voice.</p><p>“I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going to,” she said. “Do you know anything about your uncle?”</p><p>“No,” said Mary.</p><p>“Never heard your father and mother talk about him?”</p></div> </div>

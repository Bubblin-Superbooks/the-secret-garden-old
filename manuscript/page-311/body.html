His face looked dreadful, white and red and swollen, and he was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did not care an atom.</p><p>“If you scream another scream,” she said, “I’ll scream too—and I can scream louder than you can and I’ll frighten you, I’ll frighten you!”</p><p>He actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so. The scream which had been coming almost choked him. The tears were streaming down his face and he shook all over.</p></div> </div>

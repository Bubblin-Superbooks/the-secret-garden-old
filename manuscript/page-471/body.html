I wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the Magic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I couldn’t lie still. I got up and looked out of the window. The room was quite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made me go and pull the cord. She looked right down at me as if she were laughing because she was glad I was standing there. It made me like to look at her. I want to see her laughing like that all the time. I think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.”</p><p>“You are so like her now,” said Mary, “that sometimes I think perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy.”</p><p>That idea seemed to impress Colin. He thought it over and then answered her slowly.</p></div> </div>

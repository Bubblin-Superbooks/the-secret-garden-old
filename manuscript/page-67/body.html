<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden. He looked startled when he saw Mary, and then touched his cap. He had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased to see her—but then she was displeased with his garden and wore her “quite contrary” expression, and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see him.</p><p>“What is this place?” she asked.</p><p>“One o’ th’ kitchen-gardens,” he answered.</p><p>“What is that?” said Mary, pointing through the other green door.</p><p>“Another of ’em,” shortly. “There’s another on t’other side o’ th’ wall an’ there’s th’ orchard t’other side o’ that.”</p><p>“Can I go in them?” asked Mary.</p><p>“If tha’ likes. But there’s nowt to see.”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Mary made no response. She went down the path</p></div> </div>
